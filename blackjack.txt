                  Within this code snippet, we see the implementation of a while loop. This is placed there so when the player bets more than the total amount of money they have, the bet won't go through! As you can see, if the bet they placed is greater than the amount of money they have, an alert will pop up saying that you do not have enough money and will need to input a valid number. This will keep happening until they enter a valid input

                  ➙ This game is always YOU vs THE DEALER. In this simplified version of the game, the objective is simple, get as close as you can to 21 without going over.
                  <br><br>
                  ➙ Each hand, you have three options: <strong>TO STAND</strong> (you don't get dealt a card), <strong>TO HIT</strong> (get dealt another card), and <strong>TO DOUBLE</strong> (double your current bet if possible; it works like a hit but you only draw one card, good to use when you have a 10 or 11 after your first 2 cards, you can only double your first turn)
                  <br><br>
                  ➙ If you go over 21, this is called a bust and you automatically lose the hand.
                  <br><br>
                  ➙ The dealer must keep hitting until they reach a number above 16. Just like with the player, if the dealer goes above 21, they automatically lose. 
                  <br><br>
                  ➙ If nobody busts, whoever has the higher sum of numbers wins. If the sum is equal, you don't win or lose any money. 
                  <br><br>
                  ➙ If you win, you win the amount of money you bet, if you lose, you lose the amount of money you bet.
