                  Within this code snippet, we see the implementation of a while loop. This is placed there so when the player bets more than the total amount of money they have, the bet won't go through! As you can see, if the bet they placed is greater than the amount of money they have, an alert will pop up saying that you do not have enough money and will need to input a valid number. This will keep happening until they enter a valid input

                  After the player loses all their money, we get them to choose a number between 5 and 10 and that's the number of times a message telling them not to gamble will pop up. Using a for loop, it will go from the first number up to the number they input and repeat the same sentence each time. Hopefully the Bart Simpson writing on the chalk board method will work here!

                  Our code includes the use of a logical operation. The use of <strong>|  |</strong> allows another answer to be correct. In this code, when the prompt for hitOrStand comes up, the code will accept "S", "s", "Stand", or "stand" to stand. If one of these strings are the inputs, the loop will break.

                  This piece of code lists that if the dealer's sum is over 21, the dealer busts and you win money. If that does not happen (else if), if the dealer's sum is bigger than player's sum, you lose and you lose money. If that does not happen (else if), and the player's sum is bigger than the dealer's sum, you win and you win money. If none of that happens (else), that means that the two sums are equal and it's a tie!

                  The first number randomizer is to determine the number of the card. It generates a number between 1 and 13, since there are that many names in a deck of cards (including A, J, Q, K).<br><br>The second number randomizer is to determine the suite of the card. It generates a number between 1 and 4 as there are four suites that the number could be in a deck of cards (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades).
