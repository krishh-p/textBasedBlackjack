                  ➙ Each ace is worth either 1 or 11 points.
                  <br><br>
                  ➙ For all cards that belong to the two-to-ten string, the rule is the same – their rank equals their point value. If you hold a 5, for example, you hold exactly 5 points.
                  <br><br>
                  ➙ Every face card, be it a Jack, a Queen, or a King, is worth 10 points.

                  General Rules
               </h1>
               <p id="paragraphs">
                  ➙ This game is always YOU vs THE DEALER. In this simplified version of the game, the objective is simple, get as close as you can to 21 without going over.
                  <br><br>
                  ➙ Each hand, you have three options: <strong>TO STAND</strong> (you don't get dealt a card), <strong>TO HIT</strong> (get dealt another card), and <strong>TO DOUBLE</strong> (double your current bet if possible; it works like a hit but you only draw one card, good to use when you have a 10 or 11 after your first 2 cards, you can only double your first turn)
                  <br><br>
                  ➙ If you go over 21, this is called a bust and you automatically lose the hand.
                  <br><br>
                  ➙ The dealer must keep hitting until they reach a number above 16. Just like with the player, if the dealer goes above 21, they automatically lose. 
                  <br><br>
                  ➙ If nobody busts, whoever has the higher sum of numbers wins. If the sum is equal, you don't win or lose any money. 
                  <br><br>
                  ➙ If you win, you win the amount of money you bet, if you lose, you lose the amount of money you bet.
                  <br><br>
                  ➙ To get a blackjack, you must get an Ace and a 10 card in your first 2 cards. This pays 1.5 times your bet.

                  You will be greeted with this alert when you first enter the game! After clicking enter to the first alert, a second alert will appear, showing you the total amount of money you have to put on the line!

                  After the second alert, you will be asked a question. How much money are you willing to bet for that hand/round? After you input the amount of money you are willing to bet, the dealer starts to deal your cards out. You will be able to see two of your cards and one of the dealers card. Now you have a <strong> VERY IMPORTANT CHOICE TO MAKE!</strong> Will you hit (ask for another card), or stand (stick with the amount you have). <strong> BUT JUST REMEMBER THAT YOU NEED TO BE THE CLOSEST TO 21!!</strong>
